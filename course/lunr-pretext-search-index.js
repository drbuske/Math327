Solution curves often approach equilibrium solutions as increases, or move away as increases. This is called stability .   If all nearby solution curves approach , then the equilibrium is called a sink ( stable ).  If at least some nearby solution curves do not approach , then the equilibrium is called unstable .

  "title": "Daily Prep 1.7 - Numerical Methods: Euler’s Method",
  "body": " Daily Prep 1.7 - Numerical Methods: Euler's Method   Overview  Many differential equations cannot be solved exactly, yet we still need to understand how their solutions behave. Numerical methods provide a way to approximate solutions by replacing the continuous differential equation with a sequence of discrete steps that can be carried out by hand, by calculator, or by computer. In earlier chapters, slope fields offered a qualitative sense of how solutions evolve. Numerical methods build on this idea by giving a systematic procedure for constructing approximate solution curves.  The foundational idea is simple: if we know a point on a solution curve and its slope, then we can follow that slope a short distance to obtain an approximate value of the solution at a nearby point. Euler’s method, the first and simplest numerical technique introduced in this section, does exactly this. Although Euler’s method is only a rough approximation, it reveals the key principles that underlie more accurate methods and helps establish good computational habits.  This section emphasizes how to implement numerical procedures, how to interpret their results, and how to understand their limitations. Students learn how step size affects accuracy, how numerical instability can appear, and why different methods may behave differently even when applied to the same differential equation. By the end of the section, readers will have a practical toolkit for approximating solutions and for connecting analytic, graphical, and numerical viewpoints.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new vocabulary words are indicated in italics .    Understand the motivation for numerical methods when exact solutions to differential equations cannot be found easily or at all.    Explain the idea behind approximating a solution curve by following the slope given by a differential equation.

  "body": " Daily Prep 4.2 - Matrix Algebra   Overview  This section introduces matrix algebra by beginning with the simplest case: 1×1 matrices, which behave just like real numbers under addition, scalar multiplication, and composition. From this starting point, we see how these familiar operations naturally generalize to larger matrices.  We emphasize that matrices represent linear mappings between vector spaces, and that matrix operations—such as addition, scalar multiplication, and composition (matrix multiplication)—are defined so that they behave consistently with the way linear mappings act on vectors.  We learn how to add matrices element‑wise, how scalar multiplication applies uniformly to every entry, and how matrix multiplication corresponds to composing linear transformations. Throughout, concrete numerical examples illustrate how these algebraic rules connect to the action of matrices on vectors and why mismatched matrix sizes make certain operations undefined.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new vocabulary words are indicated in italics .    Understand that matrices represent linear mappings and that 1×1 matrices behave like real numbers.

You will see how a system can be expressed compactly as a matrix equation , why elimination helps even when the matrix is not invertible or not square, and how a small set of simple operations— swapping equations, scaling equations, and adding multiples of one equation to another— can always be used to reduce a system to a form where solutions can be read off directly.

  "body": " Daily Prep 4.4 - Subspaces, Dimension, and the Kernel   Overview  This section introduces the idea that certain collections of vectors arising in linear algebra—particularly the set of solutions to a homogeneous linear equation—form what are known as subspaces of . A subspace is any subset closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication, so every linear combination of its vectors remains inside it. The notes show that familiar examples such as , the zero vector alone, or sets like in all satisfy these properties. A subspace can always be described as the span of some set of vectors, and if that spanning set is linearly independent, it forms a basis . The number of basis vectors defines the subspace’s dimension , a quantity that is unique even though many different bases may exist. This viewpoint emphasizes that subspaces behave like smaller Euclidean spaces embedded inside higher-dimensional ones and that vectors in a ‑dimensional subspace can be coordinatized using numbers once a basis is chosen.

Yes, because the defining equation is linear.    Not quite. Only homogeneous linear equations (right-hand side equal to zero) define subspaces. This plane does not pass through the origin.

(The section explains that subspaces arise as solution sets to homogeneous equations—kernels.)      No, because it contains infinitely many points.    Subspaces can be infinite.

By the Rank–Nullity theorem, The section emphasizes that kernels are always subspaces and have a well‑defined dimension.       contains exactly one nonzero vector.    No. A ‑dimensional subspace contains infinitely many nonzero vectors.      Every vector in has a unique expression as with and .    No. This incorrectly suggests the range is trivial. Only the decomposition with a complementary subspace (not necessarily ) is guaranteed.       must equal .    Incorrect. is a ‑dimensional subspace of , not literally . Subspaces “look like” only in abstract structure, not as literal coordinate spaces.      Use and recall that kernels are always subspaces.

The section emphasizes that kernels of linear maps are subspaces with well‑defined dimension.    Use:      Subspace Check   Fill in the blank by choosing the correct statement. A set is a subspace of if it is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication, and it must contain _____ .      the zero vector    Correct! A subspace must include , because closure under scalar multiplication requires that be in the set. This is emphasized in the subspaces section.      all standard basis vectors    No. A subspace may or may not contain individual basis vectors like or ; only closure properties matter.      every vector of    Incorrect. That would describe the entire space, not a general subspace.      all solutions to at least one linear equation    Not quite. Only homogeneous linear equations guarantee subspaces.      What vector must appear when you multiply any vector in the set by zero?      Let . Compute two sample vectors in , add them, and check whether the sum lies in . Then multiply one vector by a scalar and check whether the result lies in .    Pick two simple vectors in , for instance and . Their sum is , which is still of the form , so it lies in . Next take a scalar multiple, for example , which is again of the form , so it also lies in . These computations illustrate the closure properties that the section lists as defining a subspace.      Let as above. Express as a scalar multiple of a single vector and use this to find a basis for . Then compute the dimension of .    We can rewrite any vector in as . Hence . Because is nonzero, it is linearly independent, so is a basis for . A basis with one vector means , matching the section’s explanation that a ‑dimensional subspace behaves like .      Consider the linear transformation defined by Compute the kernel of by solving the homogeneous system and . Then find a basis for and compute its dimension.    Solving the system:  From we get . From we get . Letting , a free variable, we obtain   Thus . The basis is , and the dimension is , consistent with the theoretical description that kernels are subspaces of and have well-defined dimension.       Consider an arbitrary subset . Students often think that a subspace must “look geometric” (a line through the origin, a plane through the origin, etc.). Provide a conceptual explanation—without checking closure conditions on any specific examples—of why requiring closure under all linear combinations (not just addition or scalar multiplication alone) is the essential feature that distinguishes subspaces from general subsets.    A subspace must behave like a smaller copy of living inside , meaning that vectors can be combined in exactly the same ways we can combine ordinary vectors in —by forming any linear combination.  If a subset is closed under both addition and scalar multiplication, then it is automatically closed under all linear combinations (because is simply repeated use of these two operations). The section emphasizes that this “linear–combination stability” is what makes the solution set of a homogeneous linear system behave like a Euclidean space and justifies calling it a subspace. Without this full closure property, the set would not support the algebraic structure required for bases, dimension, or unique coordinate representations.       The notes state that while the dimension of a subspace is unique, the basis is not. Explain conceptually—without doing any computations— why a subspace can have many different bases, but cannot have more than one dimension. Use ideas from the section to justify why different bases still span “the same amount of space.”    Every basis of a subspace has two defining features: the vectors must be linearly independent, and they must span all of  . Many different choices of spanning vectors can achieve this job, because starting from one basis we can replace vectors with new ones obtained from linear combinations, as long as we maintain independence and still span the whole set. Therefore, many bases exist.  However, the number of vectors in any basis is fixed: it is the dimension of the subspace. If one basis had more vectors than another, that would contradict the meaning of “linearly independent spanning set,” since the section explains that a subspace has a unique positive integer such that every vector in can be written uniquely as a combination of independent basis vectors. This uniqueness of representation forces the dimension to be unique, even though the choice of basis is not.       The kernel of a linear transformation is defined as the set .  Provide a conceptual explanation of why the kernel must always be a subspace, and describe what this tells us about the “shape” of solution sets to homogeneous linear equations.    Because is linear, and for all scalars .  If and are in the kernel, then and , so and . Thus the kernel contains every linear combination of its vectors; it is automatically a subspace.  Conceptually, this means the solution set to any homogeneous linear system “inherits” the geometry of a Euclidean subspace: it behaves like a flat space of some dimension , possibly much smaller than . The notes highlight this by explaining that kernels look and act like once a basis has been chosen, and vectors in the kernel have unique coordinate representations in terms of that basis.       Advanced learning objectives  In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform, with practice:    Determine whether a given subset of is a subspace by verifying closure under linear combinations.    Construct a basis for a subspace by extracting a linearly independent spanning set from a larger (possibly redundant) list of vectors.     Explain why every nontrivial subspace has a unique dimension and how different bases represent vectors using different coordinate tuples.      "

Instead of a single function , we may have several functions governed by multiple differential equations, each involving the variables and their derivatives. The section explains that systems can be of various orders—first‑order systems being the most common—and solutions consist of a collection of functions that simultaneously satisfy all equations in the system. Initial conditions must specify all dependent variables (and possibly their derivatives) at a given point. The section includes simple examples showing how some systems can be solved by decoupling: solving one equation first and then substituting into the others. This introduces the basic terminology and structure that lead naturally to matrix methods and linear systems in later sections.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting.

Exercises   What is a system of ODEs?   Which of the following best describes a system of ODEs?      A collection of differential equations involving several dependent variables and their derivatives.    Correct. A system consists of multiple ODEs involving several dependent variables.      A single equation that has more than one independent variable.    Incorrect. Systems involve *several dependent variables*, not multiple independent variables.      Any ODE with order greater than one.    No. Higher-order ODEs are not necessarily systems.       What is a solution to a system?   For a first-order system , what does it mean to be a solution ?      A triple of functions that satisfies all three equations simultaneously.    Correct. A solution consists of functions that satisfy every equation in the system.      Any function that satisfies at least one equation.    No. A solution must satisfy *all* equations in the system.      Only must satisfy its equation; the other functions may be arbitrary.    Incorrect. Every dependent variable must satisfy its own ODE.       Initial Conditions for Systems   For a system with dependent variables , what do appropriate initial conditions look like?      Values for each dependent variable at a point, such as , , .    Correct. An initial condition must specify each variable’s value at the starting time.      Only one initial value is needed, since the equations are linked.    No. Each variable requires its own initial value.      Only derivatives need initial values.    Incorrect for first-order systems; values of the variables themselves must be specified.       Determining the Order of a System   Consider the system What is the order of this system?      Second-order, because the highest derivatives in the system are second derivatives.    Correct. The section explains that the order of a system is the highest derivative appearing in any of the equations.     First-order, because there are two equations.   No. The number of equations does not determine order.     Fourth-order, because two second derivatives add up to order four.   Incorrect. Orders are not added; the system’s order is simply the highest derivative that appears.       Understanding a General Solution   A system of two first-order ODEs has a general solution What does this general solution represent?      A family of solutions containing two arbitrary constants, one for each initial condition of the system.    Correct. For a system with two dependent variables, the general solution contains two constants so that any initial conditions and can be matched.     A single solution valid only for the initial condition .   No. This general solution works for any initial conditions.     A solution that is valid only when .   No. and are independent constants.        Consider the pair of equations Explain why this pair of equations forms a first-order system of ODEs, and identify the dependent and independent variables.    This is a first-order system because each equation involves only the first derivatives and and no higher derivatives. A system of ODEs consists of several differential equations involving multiple dependent variables.  The dependent variables are and , and the independent variable is the implied variable (typically or ) with respect to which the derivatives are taken.      Suppose we have a first-order system What does it mean for a pair of functions to be a solution to this system?    A solution to the system is a pair of functions and that satisfy both differential equations for all relevant values of . That is, and simultaneously.  Because the system has two dependent variables, both must satisfy their equations for the pair to count as a valid solution.      Consider the system from the section: with initial conditions and . Solve for and then use it to find .    We begin by observing that the first equation, , is independent of . This makes the system decoupled in the sense described in the section: we can solve for first and then substitute it into the equation for .  Solve : the general solution is . Apply the initial condition : , hence .  Therefore,   Next, substitute into the second equation . We obtain the first-order linear ODE:   Rewrite this in standard linear form: The integrating factor is Multiplying through by the integrating factor gives Integrating both sides yields   Solving for , we get Now apply the initial condition . When we have Hence .  Therefore,   Putting both components together, the solution to the system is        Advanced learning objectives  In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform, with practice:    Solve simple systems by decoupling , first solving one equation and then substituting its solution into the remaining equations.    Interpret how general solutions of systems depend on several arbitrary constants and compare this structure to the general solution of a single ODE.     Describe how a single higher‑order ODE can be rewritten as a first‑order system , motivating the matrix‑based viewpoint that follows in later sections.      "
