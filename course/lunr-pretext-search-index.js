A slope field on a square grid showing short line segments that tilt downward to the right above the x‑axis and tilt upward to the right below the x‑axis. Near the horizontal line y = 2, the segments are nearly horizontal. The slopes become steeper as y moves away from 2 in either direction.     Solution curves often approach equilibrium solutions as increases, or move away as increases. This is called stability .   If all nearby solution curves approach , then the equilibrium is called a sink ( stable ).  If at least some nearby solution curves do not approach , then the equilibrium is called unstable .

  "title": "Daily Prep 1.7 - Numerical Methods: Euler’s Method",
  "body": " Daily Prep 1.7 - Numerical Methods: Euler's Method   Overview  Many differential equations cannot be solved exactly, yet we still need to understand how their solutions behave. Numerical methods provide a way to approximate solutions by replacing the continuous differential equation with a sequence of discrete steps that can be carried out by hand, by calculator, or by computer. In earlier chapters, slope fields offered a qualitative sense of how solutions evolve. Numerical methods build on this idea by giving a systematic procedure for constructing approximate solution curves.  The foundational idea is simple: if we know a point on a solution curve and its slope, then we can follow that slope a short distance to obtain an approximate value of the solution at a nearby point. Euler’s method, the first and simplest numerical technique introduced in this section, does exactly this. Although Euler’s method is only a rough approximation, it reveals the key principles that underlie more accurate methods and helps establish good computational habits.  This section emphasizes how to implement numerical procedures, how to interpret their results, and how to understand their limitations. Students learn how step size affects accuracy, how numerical instability can appear, and why different methods may behave differently even when applied to the same differential equation. By the end of the section, readers will have a practical toolkit for approximating solutions and for connecting analytic, graphical, and numerical viewpoints.    Basic learning objectives  These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency when you arrive at our next class meeting. Important new vocabulary words are indicated in italics .    Understand the motivation for numerical methods when exact solutions to differential equations cannot be found easily or at all.    Explain the idea behind approximating a solution curve by following the slope given by a differential equation.    Use Euler’s method to generate approximate solution values for a first-order initial value problem with a given step size.
