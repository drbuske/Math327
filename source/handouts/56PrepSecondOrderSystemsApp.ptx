<title>Daily Prep 5.6 - Second Order Systems and Applications</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>
<p>
We now introduce second-order systems of differential equations, with a 
central focus on physical applications such as undamped mass–spring systems. 
Instead of rewriting these problems as large first-order systems, the section 
treats them directly in their natural second-order form, where the displacement 
vector <m>\vec{x}</m> satisfies an equation of the type <m>M \vec{x}'' = K \vec{x}</m>, 
with <m>M</m> the mass matrix and <m>K</m> the stiffness matrix.  Using Hooke’s 
law and Newton’s second law, the dynamics of several coupled masses can be 
expressed compactly in matrix notation, revealing structural patterns that 
generalize to an arbitrary number of masses.  Because <m>M</m> is diagonal and 
invertible, the system can be rewritten as <m>\vec{x}'' = M^{-1} K \vec{x}</m>, 
which leads to oscillatory behavior governed by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
of <m>M^{-1}K</m>.  The section highlights how these ideas connect discrete 
mass–spring models to continuum models such as the wave equation, showing how 
second-order systems arise naturally in many physical contexts.

      <feedback>
        <p>
          Correct. Each mass is nonzero, and <m>M</m> is diagonal, so

  <exercise xml:id="secondorderopennew1">
    <title>Energy Interpretation of a Second-Order System</title>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider a second-order system of the form 
        <m>M \vec{x}'' = K \vec{x}</m>, where <m>M</m> is the mass matrix 
        and <m>K</m> is the stiffness matrix of an undamped mass–spring 
        system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) Explain why this system conserves mechanical energy when there is 
        no damping.  
        <br/>
        (b) Describe the physical meaning of the matrices <m>M</m> and 
        <m>K</m> in terms of kinetic and potential energy.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        <strong>(a)</strong>  
        In an undamped mass–spring system, no forces remove energy from the 
        system. The springs store <em>potential energy</em> and the masses 
        carry <em>kinetic energy</em>, and energy simply transfers back and 
        forth between these two forms.  
        The equation <m>M \vec{x}'' = K \vec{x}</m> results from applying 
        Newton’s second law and Hooke’s law to the system, and because no 
        damping forces are present, the total mechanical energy
      </p>

      <me>
        E(t) = \tfrac12 (\vec{x}')^{\!T} M \vec{x}' 
              + \tfrac12 \vec{x}^{T} K \vec{x}
      </me>

      <p>
        remains constant.  
        This conservation reflects exactly the behavior of the undamped 
        multi-mass system.  
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(b)</strong>  
        The matrix <m>M</m> represents the distribution of <em>inertia</em> 
        in the system. Because it is diagonal with entries <m>m_i</m>, the 
        kinetic energy term  
      </p>

      <me>
        \tfrac12 (\vec{x}')^{\!T} M \vec{x}'
      </me>

      <p>
        is exactly 
        <m>\tfrac12 ( m_1 x_1'^2 + m_2 x_2'^2 + \cdots )</m>.  
        The stiffness matrix <m>K</m> encodes how the springs resist 
        displacement. The potential energy stored in the system is
      </p>

      <me>
        \tfrac12 \vec{x}^{T} K \vec{x}.
      </me>

      <p>
        Off-diagonal entries of <m>K</m> represent coupling between masses 
        (neighboring displacements affect each other), while diagonal entries 
        reflect how strongly the system resists stretching at each mass 
        location.  
        This matches the physical interpretation provided alongside the 
        construction of <m>M</m> and <m>K</m> in the text.
      </p>
    </solution>

  <!-- PROBLEM 2 -->
  <exercise xml:id="secondorderopennew2">
    <title>Understanding Normal Modes Without Calculation</title>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose a three-mass undamped spring system is modeled by 
        <m>M \vec{x}'' = K \vec{x}</m>.  
        Let the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of <m>M^{-1}K</m> be 
        <m>(-\omega_1^2, \vec{v}_1)</m>, <m>(-\omega_2^2, \vec{v}_2)</m>, 
        and <m>(-\omega_3^2, \vec{v}_3)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explain, in words and without doing any computation, what the motion 
        <em>looks like</em> when the system is started exactly in the shape of 
        the eigenvector <m>\vec{v}_2</m> with some initial velocity along 
        <m>\vec{v}_2</m>.  
        Why does no other mode appear in the motion?
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        If the initial displacement and velocity are both multiples of 
        <m>\vec{v}_2</m>, then the system begins in the exact shape of the 
        <em>second normal mode</em>.  
        Each eigenpair produces an independent 
        oscillatory solution <m>\vec{v}_i e^{\pm i\omega_i t}</m>, and that 
        the general motion is a linear combination of these normal modes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because <m>\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \vec{v}_3</m> form a basis of 
        independent modes, any displacement can be written as a combination 
        of them.  
        But if the initial state lies <em>entirely</em> in the direction of 
        <m>\vec{v}_2</m>, there is no component of <m>\vec{v}_1</m> or 
        <m>\vec{v}_3</m> in the initial condition.  
        Therefore the solution must remain a pure oscillation of the form
      </p>

      <me>
        \vec{x}(t) = A \vec{v}_2 \cos(\omega_2 t)
                    + B \vec{v}_2 \sin(\omega_2 t),
      </me>

      <p>
        with frequency <m>\omega_2</m>.  
        No other frequency can appear because there is no component of the 
        initial state aligned with the other eigenvectors.  
        This is exactly the decoupling property of normal modes.
