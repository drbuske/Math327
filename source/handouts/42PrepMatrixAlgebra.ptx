<title>Daily Prep 4.2 - Matrix Algebra</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p> 
This section introduces matrix algebra by beginning with the simplest case:
    1×1 matrices, which behave just like real numbers under addition, scalar
    multiplication, and composition. From this starting point, we see how
    these familiar operations naturally generalize to larger matrices.
  </p>

<p>
    We emphasize that matrices represent linear mappings between vector
    spaces, and that matrix operations—such as addition, scalar multiplication,
    and composition (matrix multiplication)—are defined so that they behave
    consistently with the way linear mappings act on vectors. 
  </p>


<p>
    We learn how to add matrices element‑wise, how scalar multiplication 
    applies uniformly to every entry, and how matrix multiplication corresponds 
    to composing linear transformations. Throughout, concrete numerical examples 
    illustrate how these algebraic rules connect to the action of matrices on 
    vectors and why mismatched matrix sizes make certain operations undefined.

          In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able 
          to perform, with practice:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
Explain conceptually how matrix multiplication corresponds to composition
      of linear mappings.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> 
Analyze examples illustrating how matrix operations affect the resulting
      action on vectors, using algebraic structure to justify results rather
      than computation alone.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
Relate familiar 1×1 mappings to higher‑dimensional cases and generalize
      the underlying algebraic principles to arbitrary matrix sizes.

            </p>
          </li>
