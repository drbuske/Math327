<title>Daily Prep 0.2 - What are Differential Equations?</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p>
    Differential equations are central to science and engineering 
    because the laws of physics are written in this form and they describe how quantities 
    change over time. You have already encountered and even solved 
    simple differential equations in calculus, even if you did not recognize them. This section 
    illustrates what a differential equation looks like and clarifies key ideas like dependent and independent variables. 
    It also demonstrates that many differential equations can have multiple valid solutions, 
    showing how to check a proposed solution by substitution.

<exercise xml:id="order-of-de">
  <statement>
    <p>
      What does the <em>order</em> of a differential equation refer to?
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      The <em>order</em> of a differential equation is the order of the
      highest derivative that appears in the equation.  
      For example, if the largest derivative present is <m>x''</m>, then the
      equation is second order; if the highest derivative is <m>y^{(4)}</m>,
      then it is fourth order.  
    </p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

  <!-- EXERCISE 1 -->
  <exercise xml:id="de-solutions-vs-values">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Values such as <m>x = 2</m> are typical solutions to algebraic equations 
        (for example, <m>x = 2</m> solves <m>3x = 6</m>).  
        What objects are typical solutions to differential equations?
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        Differential equations involve an unknown function and its derivatives, 
        so their solutions are <em>functions</em>, not numbers.  
        These functions must satisfy the relationship between derivatives given 
        in the equation.  
        Solving a differential equation means finding 
        a function <m>x(t)</m> that makes the equation true when substituted.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>



  <!-- EXERCISE 2 -->
  <exercise xml:id="autonomous-vs-not">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Give a specific example of a differential equation that is 
        <em>autonomous</em> and one that is <em>not</em> autonomous.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        An autonomous differential equation is one in which the independent 
        variable (often <m>t</m>) does not appear explicitly.  
        For example:
      </p>

      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = y(1 - y)
      </me>

      <p>
        is autonomous because the right-hand side depends only on <m>y</m>.  
        A non-autonomous example is:
      </p>

      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = t + y
      </me>

      <p>
        because the independent variable <m>t</m> appears explicitly.  
        Differential equations are classified according 
        to such features.

  <exercise xml:id="newton-law-cooling-conceptual">
    <title>Newton’s Law of Cooling</title>

    <statement>
      <p>
        The time rate of change of the temperature <m>T(t)</m> of a body is 
        proportional to the difference between <m>T</m> and the surrounding 
        temperature <m>A</m>.  
        That is,
      </p>

      <me>
        \frac{dT}{dt} = -k (T - A), k &gt; 0.

      <ol label="(a)">
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>T &gt; A</m>, is <m>\frac{dT}{dt}</m> positive, negative, or zero?  
            Is the body warming or cooling?

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What can be said if <m>T &lt; A</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        <strong>(a)</strong>  
        If <m>T > A</m>, then <m>(T - A) &gt; 0</m>, so  
        <m>\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - A) &lt; 0</m>.  
        Thus the temperature is decreasing: the body is <em>cooling</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>(b)</strong>  
        If <m>T &lt; A</m>, then <m>(T - A) &lt; 0</m>, so  
        <m>\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - A) &gt; 0</m>.  
        The temperature increases: the body is <em>warming</em>.
      </p>
