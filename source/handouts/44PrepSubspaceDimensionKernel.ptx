<section>
    <title>Overview</title>
<p>
This section introduces the idea that certain collections of vectors arising in linear algebra—particularly the set of solutions to a homogeneous linear equation—form what are known as <em>subspaces</em> of <m>\mathbb{R}^{n}</m>.
A subspace is any subset closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication, so every linear combination of its vectors remains inside it.
The notes show that familiar examples such as <m>\mathbb{R}^{n}</m>, the zero vector alone, or sets like <m>\{(a,a): a \in \mathbb{R}\}</m> in <m>\mathbb{R}^{2}</m> all satisfy these properties.
A subspace can always be described as the span of some set of vectors, and if that spanning set is linearly independent, it forms a <em>basis</em>.
The number of basis vectors defines the subspace’s <em>dimension</em>, a quantity that is unique even though many different bases may exist.
This viewpoint emphasizes that subspaces behave like smaller Euclidean spaces embedded inside higher-dimensional ones and that vectors in a <m>k</m>‑dimensional subspace can be coordinatized using <m>k</m> numbers once a basis is chosen.

    <title>Is this a subspace?</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the subset
        <m>S=\{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3 : x - y + z = 0\}</m>.
        Is <m>S</m> a subspace of <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>?

        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>
            Correct. <m>S</m> is the solution set to the homogeneous linear equation
            <m>x - y + z = 0</m>, so it is closed under all linear combinations and therefore
            is a subspace. (Homogeneous solution sets are kernels of linear maps.)

          <p>No, because it is “just” a plane.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>
            Not quite. Planes through the origin defined by a homogeneous linear equation are 
            subspaces; the key property is closure under linear combinations.

        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>
            Subspaces need not be the whole space—they just need to contain <m>\vec{0}</m>
            and be closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

        <p>Yes, because the defining equation is linear.</p>
      </statement>
      <feedback>
        <p>
          Not quite. Only <em>homogeneous</em> linear equations 
          (right-hand side equal to zero) define subspaces.  
          This plane does not pass through the origin.

      </feedback>
    </choice>

    <choice correct="yes">
      <statement>
        <p>No, because the set does not contain the zero vector.</p>
      </statement>
      <feedback>
        <p>
          Correct. A subspace must contain <m>\vec{0}</m> and must be closed 
          under all linear combinations.  
          A nonhomogeneous equation such as 
          <m>x + 2y + 3z = 5</m> cannot define a subspace. 
          (The section explains that subspaces arise as solution sets 
          to <em>homogeneous</em> equations—kernels.)

        <p>
          Subspaces can be infinite.  
          The issue is that this set is not closed under linear combinations.

        <p>Yes, because it is a plane in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.</p>

        <p>
          Only planes through the origin are subspaces.

      <feedback>
        <p>
          Correct. By the Rank–Nullity theorem,

          No. This incorrectly suggests the range is trivial.

<exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S = \{(a,a) : a \in \mathbb{R}\} \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}</m>.
  Compute two sample vectors in <m>S</m>, add them, and check whether the sum lies in <m>S</m>.
  Then multiply one vector by a scalar and check whether the result lies in <m>S</m>.
</p>
    </statement>

    
<solution>
      <p>
        Pick two simple vectors in <m>S</m>, for instance <m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(3,3)</m>. 
        Their sum is
        <m>(1,1) + (3,3) = (4,4)</m>,
        which is still of the form <m>(a,a)</m>, so it lies in <m>S</m>.  
        Next take a scalar multiple, for example
        <m>5(1,1) = (5,5)</m>,
        which is again of the form <m>(a,a)</m>, so it also lies in <m>S</m>. 
        These computations illustrate the closure properties that the section lists as defining a subspace.  
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  
 <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
       Let <m>S = \{(a,a) : a \in \mathbb{R}\}</m> as above.
  Express <m>(a,a)</m> as a scalar multiple of a single vector and use this to find a basis for <m>S</m>.
  Then compute the dimension of <m>S</m>.
</p>
    </statement>

<solution>
      <p>
        We can rewrite any vector in <m>S</m> as
        <m>(a,a) = a(1,1)</m>.
        Hence <m>S = \operatorname{span}\{(1,1)\}</m>.
  Because <m>(1,1)</m> is nonzero, it
 is linearly independent, so
        <m>\{(1,1)\}</m> is a basis for <m>S</m>. 
        A basis with one vector means
        <m>\dim S = 1</m>, matching the section’s explanation that a <m>k</m>‑dimensional subspace behaves like <m>\mathbb{R}^{k}</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  
<exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the linear transformation <m>L : \mathbb{R}^{3} \to \mathbb{R}^{2}</m> defined by  
        <m>
        L(x,y,z) = (x + y,\; y + z).
        </m>
        Compute the kernel of <m>L</m> by solving the homogeneous system  
        <m>x + y = 0</m> and <m>y + z = 0</m>.  
        Then find a basis for <m>\ker(L)</m> and compute its dimension.
      </p>
    </statement>

 <solution>
      <p>
        Solving the system:
      </p>
      <p>
        From <m>x + y = 0</m> we get <m>x = -y</m>.  
        From <m>y + z = 0</m> we get <m>z = -y</m>.  
        Letting <m>y = t</m>, a free variable, we obtain
        <m>(x,y,z) = (-t,\, t,\, -t) = t(-1,1,-1).</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus
        <m>\ker(L) = \operatorname{span}\{(-1,1,-1)\}</m>.
        The basis is <m>\{(-1,1,-1)\}</m>, and the dimension is  
        <m>\dim \ker(L) = 1</m>, consistent with the theoretical description that kernels are subspaces of <m>\mathbb{R}^{n}</m> and have well-defined dimension.  

      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>


  <!-- EXERCISE 4 -->
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider an arbitrary subset <m>S \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}</m>.
        Students often think that a subspace must “look geometric” (a line through the origin, a plane through the origin, etc.).  
        Provide a conceptual explanation—without checking closure conditions on any specific examples—of <em>why</em> requiring closure under <em>all</em> linear combinations 
        (not just addition or scalar multiplication alone) is the essential feature that distinguishes subspaces from general subsets. 
      </p>
    </statement>

    
<solution>
      <p>
        A subspace must behave like a smaller copy of <m>\mathbb{R}^{k}</m> living inside <m>\mathbb{R}^{n}</m>, meaning that vectors can be combined in
  exactly the same ways we can combine ordinary vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^{n}</m>—by forming <em>any</em> linear combination.
</p>
<p>
        If a subset is closed under both addition and scalar multiplication, then it is automatically closed under <em>all</em> linear combinations 
        (because <m>a\vec{x}+ b\vec{y}</m> is simply repeated use of these two operations).  
        The section emphasizes that this “linear–combination stability” is what makes the solution set of a homogeneous linear system behave like a Euclidean space 
        <m>\mathbb{R}^{k}</m> and justifies calling it a subspace.  
        Without this full closure property, the set would not support the algebraic structure required for bases, dimension, or unique coordinate representations. 
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  
<!-- EXERCISE 2 -->
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The notes state that while the dimension of a subspace is unique, the basis is not.  
        Explain conceptually—without doing any computations—<em>why</em> a subspace can have many different bases,  
        but cannot have more than one dimension.  
        Use ideas from the section to justify why different bases still span “the same amount of space.” 
      </p>
    </statement>
    
 <solution>
      <p>
        Every basis of a subspace <m>S</m> has two defining features: the vectors must be linearly independent,
  and they must span all of <m>S</m>
</p>. 
<p> Many different choices of spanning vectors can achieve this job,  
        because starting from one basis we can replace vectors with new ones obtained from linear combinations, 
        as long as we maintain independence and still span the whole set.  
        Therefore, many bases exist.  
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the <em>number</em> of vectors in any basis is fixed: it is the dimension of the subspace.  
        If one basis had more vectors than another, that would contradict the meaning of “linearly independent spanning set,”  
        since the section explains that a subspace <m>S</m> has a unique positive integer <m>k</m> such that
  every vector in <m>S</m> can be written uniquely as a combination of <m>k</m>
 independent basis vectors.  
        This uniqueness of representation forces the dimension to be unique, even though the choice of basis is not. 
 </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  
  <!-- EXERCISE 3 -->
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The kernel of a linear transformation <m>L : \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}^{m}</m> is defined as the set <m>\ker(L) = \{\vec{x}: L\vec{x}= \vec{0}\}</m>.
</p> 
<p>
        Provide a conceptual explanation of <em>why</em> the kernel must always be a subspace,  
        and describe what this tells us about the “shape” of solution sets to homogeneous linear equations.
      </p>
    </statement>

    
  <solution>
      <p>
        Because <m>L</m> is linear, <m>L(\vec{x}+ \vec{y}) = L\vec{x}+ L\vec{y}</m> and <m>L(\alpha \vec{x}) = \alpha L\vec{x}</m> for all scalars <m>\alpha</m>.
</p>

<p>
  If <m>\vec{x}</m> and <m>\vec{y}</m> are in the kernel, then <m>L\vec{x}= \vec{0}</m> and <m>L\vec{y}= \vec{0}</m>,
  so <m>L(\vec{x}+ \vec{y}) = \vec{0}</m> and <m>L(\alpha \vec{x}) = \vec{0}</m>.
        Thus the kernel contains every linear combination of its vectors; it is automatically a subspace.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceptually, this means the solution set to any homogeneous linear system “inherits” the geometry of a Euclidean subspace:  it behaves like a flat space of some dimension <m>k</m>, possibly much smaller than <m>n</m>.
  The notes highlight this by explaining that kernels look and act like <m>\mathbb{R}^{k}</m>
once a basis has been chosen,  
        and vectors in the kernel have unique coordinate representations in terms of that basis.
