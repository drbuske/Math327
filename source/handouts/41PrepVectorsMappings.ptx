<title>Daily Prep 4.1 - Vectors, Mappings, and Matrices</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>

  <p> 
   In this section we will learn how vectors, linear mappings, and matrices provide a systematic way to 
   organize and solve problems involving many variables. The text motivates linear algebra by showing 
   how even simple systems of equations generalize to high‑dimensional settings, where matrices and 
   vector operations become essential tools. You will explore n‑dimensional space, interpret vectors 
   as geometric arrows, and see how linear equations, functions, and differential‑equation models all 
   benefit from a unified matrix‑based framework.

the author states: <em>Hence, we may think of matrices being linear mappings,
