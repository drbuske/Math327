<title>Daily Prep 5.1 - Introduction to Systems of ODEs</title>

<section>
    <title>Overview</title>
<p>
We now introduce the idea of a <em>system</em> of ordinary differential 
equations, which arises whenever there are multiple dependent variables whose 
rates of change may influence one another. Instead of a single function 
<m>y(x)</m>, we may have several functions 
<m>y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n</m> governed by multiple differential equations, 
each involving the variables and their derivatives. The section explains that 
systems can be of various orders—first‑order systems being the most common—and 
solutions consist of a collection of functions that simultaneously satisfy all 
equations in the system. Initial conditions must specify all dependent variables 
(and possibly their derivatives) at a given point. The section includes simple 
examples showing how some systems can be solved by decoupling: solving one 
equation first and then substituting into the others. This introduces the basic 
terminology and structure that lead naturally to matrix methods and linear 
systems in later sections.

        Consider the pair of equations

        Explain why this pair of equations forms a <em>first-order system</em> of ODEs, and

      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        This is a first-order system because each equation involves only the
        first derivatives <m>y_1'</m> and <m>y_2'</m> and no higher derivatives.
        A system of ODEs consists of several differential equations involving
        multiple dependent variables. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The dependent variables are <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m>, and the independent
        variable is the implied variable (typically <m>t</m> or <m>x</m>) with

          <mrow> x_2' \amp = g_2(x_1,x_2,t). </mrow>

        What does it mean for a pair of functions

      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        A solution to the system is a pair of functions
        <m>x_1(t)</m> and <m>x_2(t)</m> that satisfy both differential
        equations for all relevant values of <m>t</m>. That is,

  <exercise xml:id="syssimpledecoupling">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the system from the section:
        <md>
          <mrow> y_1' \amp = y_1, </mrow>
          <mrow> y_2' \amp = y_1 y_2, </mrow>
        </md>
        with initial conditions <m>y_1(0)=1</m> and <m>y_2(0)=2</m>.
        Solve for <m>y_1(t)</m> and then use it to find <m>y_2(t)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    
<solution>
    <p>
      We begin by observing that the first equation,
      <m>y_1' = y_1</m>,
      is independent of <m>y_2</m>.  This makes the system
      <em>decoupled</em> in the sense described in the section:
      we can solve for <m>y_1</m> first and then substitute it
      into the equation for <m>y_2</m>.

</p>

    <p>
      Solve <m>y_1' = y_1</m>:
      the general solution is
      <m>y_1(t) = C_1 e^{t}</m>.
      Apply the initial condition <m>y_1(0) = 1</m>:
      <m>1 = C_1 e^0</m>, hence <m>C_1 = 1</m>.
    </p>

<p>
      Therefore,
      <me>
        y_1(t) = e^{t}.
      </me>
    </p>

    
   <p>
      Next, substitute <m>y_1(t) = e^{t}</m> into the second equation
      <m>y_2' = y_1\,y_2</m>.
      We obtain the first-order linear ODE:
      <m>
        y_2' = e^{t} y_2.
      </m>
    </p>


 <p>
      Rewrite this in standard linear form:
      <m>
        y_2' - e^{t} y_2 = 0.
      </m>
      The integrating factor is
      <m>\mu(t) = e^{-\int e^{t} \, dt} = e^{-e^{t}}.</m>
      Multiplying through by the integrating factor gives
      <m>
        (e^{-e^{t}} y_2)' = 0.
      </m>
      Integrating both sides yields
      <m>
        e^{-e^{t}} y_2 = C_2.
      </m>
    </p>

    
  <p>
      Solving for <m>y_2</m>, we get
      <me>
        y_2(t) = C_2\, e^{e^{t}}.
      </me>
      Now apply the initial condition <m>y_2(0)=2</m>.
      When <m>t=0</m> we have
      <m>
        y_2(0) = C_2\, e^{e^{0}}
               = C_2\, e^{1}
               = C_2 e.
      </m>
      Hence <m>C_2 = 2/e</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore,
      <me>
        y_2(t)
        = \frac{2}{e}\, e^{e^{t}}
        = 2\, e^{\,e^{t}-1}.
      </me>
    </p>

    
  <p>
      Putting both components together, the solution to the system is
    </p>

    <me>
      y_1(t) = e^{t}, \qquad
      y_2(t) = 2\, e^{\,e^{t}-1}.
